EnergyPlus CodeFlower
==========

This experiment visualizes source repositories of <a href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/">EnergyPlus</a> using an interactive tree. Each disc represents a file, with a radius proportional to the number of lines of code (loc). All rendering is done client-side, in JavaScript. Built with <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">d3.js</a> and branched from <a href="http://redotheweb.com/CodeFlower/">CodeFlower</a>.
